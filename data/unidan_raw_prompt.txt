[COMMENT]
Body: Mainly the submission stuff, I suppose?  Trying to get stuff out of the new queue to get some attention is a pain at times, as for comments, mainly my own hot-headedness against misinformation?

It doesn't make it right, but that's the reasoning, at least.

Body: I don't see why not!  

If the admins feel like they want to give me a second chance, I'll go back to it, but it's just numbers on the other account.  The real thing that I enjoy is talking with people, teaching and having fun on the site, and I can do that regardless of username.

Body: TEDx talk doesn't pay anything, it's voluntary if they ask you to do one, though I got wined and dined, which was nice.  The funding we raised for the crow project was about 6k.
