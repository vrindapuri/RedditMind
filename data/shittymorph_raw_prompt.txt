Body: The judge actually really laid into him besides that little joke. Here's the full quote - Judge Denise Langford Morris said: "Poor judgment is an understatement for what you did. You are extremely lucky, sir, that no one was injured or killed. Your excuses and reasons for your behavior only indicate that you lack accountability - Mr. Mathers, I really think you need to go home, and think long and hard to yourself about how back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.

Body: The most satisfying part of this video is the actual translation of what everyone in it is saying. Obviously the woman starts recording when she sees the kid being aggressive... And obviously the kid says "f you" - but when our hero comes swooping in to save the day he says "you think it's ok to hit a woman? You think it's ok to  hit a PREGNANT woman at that?! You son of a bitch are so incredibly lucky that back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.

Body: As ridiculous as it sounds, these birds are engaged in a behavior known as "mobbing." You will typically see 
"mobbing" in magpies or mockingbirds - basically its a behavior in smaller birds that are trying to defend their nests, their young, or territories. Mobbing also seems to be the best way to deter a predator, protect a food source, or even just annoy a person by getting them to read about nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.

Body: My Uncle was bit by one here in India and then did literally everything you are not supposed to do after being bit. You are supposed to seek medical attention immediately which he did not - you are supposed to remain calm but he was WAY too calm, almost apathetic. He kept saying "I'm going to be fine, it's not a big deal."  It was only when he started to feel the numbness in his hands and feet that he rushed off to the hospital. The doctors quickly injected him with several vials of anti-venom and then proceeded to lecture him about how back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.

Body: The Alan Smithee thing was also done when the movie being made was "unauthorized" in an effort to avoid being sued. One example of this is the awful "Another Night Of The Living Dead". The movie was not only horrible but it was simply a blatant cash-grab ripoff of George Romero's legendary work. I'm a zombie movie buff so gave it a watch - The sole redeeming moment in the entire movie came at the very end as the main character (the worst actress of all time) is about to be devoured by the zombie hoard - she awkwardly looks directly into the camera, and starts screaming about how back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.

Body: My favorite interaction on Reddit was with Val about 6 or 7 years ago. He responded to an article about the undertaker/mankind meme with "Legendary" and I messaged him. I had acted in film and theater when I was younger - and talking to him privately was a huge thing for me. He gave me a lot of encouragement and we discussed some of his lesser known roles... we discussed my fathers suicide. I felt acknowledged by a super-hero (BATMAN - Really?!?)  to some degree. It was surreal and appreciated. A memo went around between reddit admins about this interaction - was friends with an admin who let me know about it. This is a tragedy, and I wish his family the comfort they deserve right now. Rest easy Val and thank you for taking the time to small talk about things that were important to me. Legendary

I had done interviews about that stuff and instead invited him to come out to Montana and hike... and co-write a piece...

Body: There can be a few issues with "Hyperlactation". One is called "Foremilk" - which is a very watery milk. This milk is high in carbs and low in fat and typically will flow at the beginning of a breastfeeding session. There is also something called "Hindmilk" which is much higher in fat and usually comes at the end of the breastfeeding session. If the milk flows too forcefully or quickly, the baby could fill up in an unhealthy way on the foremilk. Foremilk is also VERY high in lactose which can cause a baby to become extremely gassy - there have even been a few instances where the babies will suddenly start talking about how back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.

Body: This is a super old photo and, oddly enough, people seem to agree that the heron had a much better chance of surviving the situation than the eel. Even when considering  the altitude from which the eel chewed itself free, the terrain that the eel would have landed in wasn't hospitable at all. It's also worth mentioning that, while this was going on,  the photographer also witnessed several eagles as well as juvenile foxes in the area discussing how back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.

Body: I went to school with Kendell since the 3rd grade and to hear he rescued Brady from the jaws of a grizzly - was NOT surprising. He has always been a beast on our wrestling team... although wrestling a grizzly is a completely different thing. I wasn't surprised at all when he got a "Carnegie Medal for Heroism" - which is basically the highest civilian medal you can get. The entire town assembled to watch his acceptance speech - and he was incredibly humble while accepting it. His response to the medal was: “It’s awesome. I’m VERY grateful to get this medal but truly I think it's more important to recognize that back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.

Body: I grew up on snake and can provide a couple of pointers - Keeping a large space around your snakes head is obviously a priority. Planning ahead to create a wide path for random movements is vital - this also  allows you to quickly reach any food without accidentally colliding with your own snake-body, which is the primary way to lose the game.  The hardest part of the entire game, in my honest opinion, is actually accurately assessing the distance between your snake and how back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.

Body: I grew up in Tunisia and there's a reason bread is prominently featured in our cuisine: We had a thing known as "The Tunisian Bread Riots" between December 1983 and January 1984. There were big demonstrations that started due to a massive rise in the cost of bread - which was caused by an IMF-imposed austerity program. These demonstrations got way out of hand and  eventually turned into full blown riots. The president of the country at the time (Habib Bourguiba) had to get on television  and ask everyone to remember how back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.

Body: I've been working at 5 Guys for almost 7 years now and if there aren't fries at the bottom of the bag, feel free to say something to the manager about it. My boss even fired a girl a few years ago who, for some reason, could not grasp the idea of throwing a few fries at the bottom. Her argument was that it was disgusting to expect people to consume fries or any food not properly contained. I'll never forget how the manager pointed towards the front door, looked her dead in the eyes, and very calmly said in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.
